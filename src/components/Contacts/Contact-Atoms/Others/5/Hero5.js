        We are aware of various forms of fraudulent communications claiming to
        be from, or associated with, the Skills Outside School Foundation
        (SOSF). These scams may be distributed via email, social media, postal
        mail, fax, or telephone, often using our foundation logo, images, or
        content taken directly from our official website. They may appear in
        different languages, and the communications are becoming increasingly
        sophisticated.
        <br />
        <br />
        If you receive any suspicious communications claiming to be from SOSF or
        associated with our foundation, please report it to us by emailing
        IT@skillsoutsideschool.com. This will allow us to investigate and, if
        necessary, take appropriate action. Please note, due to the high volume
        of scam reports, we may not be able to respond to every inquiry.
        <br />
        <br />
        Unfortunately, the number of scams is increasing, and they can be
        difficult to detect. Our IT team will do its best to work with the
        relevant stakeholders and law enforcement authorities to the extent
        possible, to combat these fraudulent activities, but we cannot stop them
        all.

        Please be aware that there have been incidents of individuals falsely
        posing as representatives or staff of the Skills Outside School
        Foundation (SOSF) or organizations posting as partners, investors or
        affiliates of SOSF, in attempts to scam people out of money or damage
        our reputation.
        <br />
        <br />
        We urge the public to be vigilant and cautious when receiving
        unsolicited requests claiming to be from SOSF fraudulently soliciting
        money on our behalf via email, social media, messaging apps, or in
        person at public locations

        <br />
        Common Scams and Hoaxes (This list is not exhaustive):
        <br />
        Fraudulent Fundraising in Public: Individuals pretending to represent
        SOSF and collecting money in public locations.
        <br />
        Posing as SOSF Staff via Email: Individuals sending emails posing as
        SOSF staff or using the names of actual SOSF staff members or management
        to ask for reimbursements or donations.
        <br />
        <br />
        Detainment Scams: Individuals claiming to be SOSF staff who have been
        detained while traveling and requesting funds for their release.
        <br />
        <br />
        Fake Social Media and App Profiles: People using social media or
        messaging apps to pose as SOSF staff or acting on behalf of SOSF, asking
        for money to cover travel costs for a fictitious SOSF staff member
        returning from a mission.
        <br />
        <br />
        Job Recruitment Scams: Scammers posing as SOSF human resources or
        recruitment staff, asking job applicants to pay fees for applying,
        interviewing, processing, or training. SOSF does not charge any fees at
        any stage of the recruitment process (application, interview,
        processing, or training).
