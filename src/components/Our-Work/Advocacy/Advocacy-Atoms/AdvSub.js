              We turn evidence into influence. Our advocacy pillar amplifies
              voices, shifts mindsets, and drives systemic change through:
              Ambassadors as Change Agents (e.g., GreenLITE, Skills on Wheels)
            </li>
            <li>
              Volunteer Mobilization (1,000+ field and strategic volunteers)
              Stakeholder Engagement (Govt, NGOs, Corporates) Data-Led Advocacy
              (e.g., influencing Nigerian life skills curriculum)
            </li>
            <li>
              Policy & Regulatory Reform (e.g., UBE Act amendment)
              Institutionalizing Interventions (e.g., Girls Empowerment in 300+
              schools)
            </li>
            <li>
              Strategic Communications (Webinars, Media, Summits) Our Theory of
              Change: Evidence-based advocacy drives lasting reform, not just
              charitableÂ goodwill.
