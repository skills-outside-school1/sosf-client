                  Collaboration is vital since no single entity can address
                  global challenges in isolation. By merging resources,
                  knowledge, and innovations across various sectors like
                  governments, NGOs, and businesses, we can amplify our impact.
                  Cross-sectoral and jurisdictional collaborations specifically
                  encourage innovation and mutual cooperation, fast-tracking our
                  progress towards the SDGs and envisioning a sustainable future
                  for all.

                  We&apos;ve historically joined hands with prominent
